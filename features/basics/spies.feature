Feature: Spies

  [Message expectations](./expecting-messages) put an example's expectation at the start, before you've invoked the
  code-under-test. Many developers prefer using an act-arrange-assert (or given-when-then)
  pattern for structuring tests. Spies are an alternate type of test double that support this
  pattern by allowing you to expect that a message has been received after the fact, using
  `have_received`.

  You can use any test double (or partial double) as a spy, but the double must be setup to
  spy on the messages you care about. Spies automatically spy on all messages,
  or you can [allow a message](./allowing-messages) to spy on it.

  `have_received` supports the same fluent interface for [setting constraints](../setting-constraints) that normal message expectations do.

  Note: The `have_received` API shown here will only work if you are using rspec-expectations.
  Note: `have_received(...).with(...)` is unable to work properly when passed arguments are mutated after the spy records the received message.

  Scenario: Using a spy
    Given a file named "spy_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      RSpec.describe "have_received" do
        it "passes when the message has been received" do
          invitation = spy('invitation')
          invitation.deliver
          expect(invitation).to have_received(:deliver)
        end
      end
      """
    When I run `rspec spy_spec.rb`
    Then the examples should all pass

  Scenario: Spy on a method on a partial double
    Given a file named "partial_double_spy_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      class Invitation
        def self.deliver; end

        it "passes when the expectation is met" do
          allow(Invitation).to receive(:deliver)
          Invitation.deliver
          expect(Invitation).to have_received(:deliver)
        end

  Scenario: Failure when the message has not been received
