Feature: expect/allow a message on any instance of a class

  Use `expect_any_instance_of(Class).to receive` to set an expectation that one
  (and only one) instance of a class receives a message before the example is
  completed. The spec will fail if no instance receives a message.

  Use `allow_any_instance_of(Class).to receive` when an instance of a class may
  respond to a particular message. This will not set an expectation on any instance
  so the spec will not fail if no instance receives the message.

  Scenario: expect a message on any instance of a class
    Given a file named "example_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      describe "expect_any_instance_of" do
        before do
          expect_any_instance_of(Object).to receive(:foo).and_return(:return_value)
        end

        it "verifies that one instance of the class receives the message" do
          o = Object.new
          expect(o.foo).to eq(:return_value)
        end

        it "fails if no instance receives that message" do
          o = Object.new
        end
      end
      """
    When I run `rspec example_spec.rb`
    Then the output should contain "2 examples, 1 failure"
    And the output should contain "1) expect_any_instance_of fails if no instance receives that message"
