Feature: Dynamic classes

  Verifying instance doubles do not support methods which the class reports to not exist
  since an actual instance of the class would be required to verify against. This is commonly
  the case when `method_missing` is used.

  There are a few ways to work around this. If the object has already been loaded you may
  consider using an [`object_double`](./using-an-object-double), but that cannot work if you are testing in isolation.
  Alternatively you could implement the methods directly (calling `super` to return the `method_missing` definition).

  Some of these classes may have methods to define these methods on the objects at runtime.
  (For example, `ActiveRecord` does this to define methods from database columns.) For these
  cases we provide an API which can be used to customise verifying doubles on creation. We
  use this ourselves in `rspec-rails` to set up some niceties for you.

  These types of methods are supported at class level (with `class_double`) however, since
  `respond_to?` can be queried directly on the class.

  Background:
    Given a file named "lib/fake_active_record.rb" with:
      """ruby
      class FakeActiveRecord
        COLUMNS = %w[name email]

        def respond_to_missing?(method_name)
          COLUMNS.include?(method_name.to_s) || super
        end

        def method_missing(method_name, *args)
          if respond_to?(method_name)
            instance_variable_get("@#{method_name}")
          else
            super
          end
        end

        def self.define_attribute_methods
          COLUMNS.each do |name|
            define_method(name) { instance_variable_get("@#{name}") }
          end
        end
      end
      """

    Given a file named "spec/user_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require 'user'

      RSpec.describe User do
        it 'can be doubled' do

        end
      end
      """

  Scenario: fails with method missing

    Given a file named "lib/user.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require 'fake_active_record'

      class User < FakeActiveRecord
      end
      """

    When I run `rspec spec/user_spec.rb`
    Then the output should contain "1 example, 1 failure"

  Scenario: workaround with explicit definitions

    Given a file named "lib/user.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require 'fake_active_record'

      class User < FakeActiveRecord
        def name;  super end
        def email; super end
      end
      """

    When I run `rspec spec/user_spec.rb`
    Then the examples should all pass

  Scenario: workaround using callback

    Given a file named "lib/user.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require 'fake_active_record'

      class User < FakeActiveRecord
      end
      """
    And a file named "spec/fake_record_helper.rb" with:
      """ruby
      RSpec.configuration.mock_with(:rspec) do |config|
        config.before_verifying_doubles do |reference|
          reference.target.define_attribute_methods
        end
      end
      #
      # or you can use:

      # end
      """

    When I run `rspec -r fake_record_helper spec/user_spec.rb`
