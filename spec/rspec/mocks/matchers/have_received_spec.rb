    # This shared example group is highly unusual as it is used to test how
    # `have_received` works in two situations:
    #
    # * With rspec-mocks as a standalone library.
    # * Together with rspec-expectations.
    #
    # To simulate the former, we've had to hack things a bit. Special care must be taken:
    #
    # * Only define examples with `it`, (not `fit`, `xit`, `specify`, etc). We redefine
    #   `it` below to make it support our needs here but that definition isn't applied to
    #   the other forms.
    # * All normal expectations must use `_expect`, not `expect`. Expectations
    #   for `have_received` should use `expect`.
