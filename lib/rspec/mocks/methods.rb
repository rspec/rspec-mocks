      # Chains can be arbitrarily long, which makes it quite painless to

      # use of `stub_chain` a code smell. Even though not all code smells
      # indicate real problems (think fluent interfaces), `stub_chain` still
      # results in brittle examples.  For example, if you write
      # `foo.stub_chain(:bar, :baz => 37)` in a spec and then the
      # implementation calls `foo.baz.bar`, the stub will not work.

      #
      #     double.stub_chain("foo.bar") { :baz }
      #     double.stub_chain(:foo, :bar => :baz)
      #     double.stub_chain(:foo, :bar) { :baz }

      #     # Given any of ^^ these three forms ^^:
      #     double.foo.bar # => :baz
