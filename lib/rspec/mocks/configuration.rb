module RSpec
  module Mocks
    # Provides configuration options for rspec-mocks.
    class Configuration
      # Adds `stub` and `should_receive` to the given
      # modules or classes. This is usually only necessary
      # if you application uses some proxy classes that
      # "strip themselves down" to a bare minimum set of
      # methods and remove `stub` and `should_receive` in
      # the process.
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   RSpec.configure do |rspec|
      #     rspec.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
      #       mocks.add_stub_and_should_receive_to Delegator
      #     end
      #   end

      def add_stub_and_should_receive_to(*modules)
        modules.each do |mod|
          mod.__send__(:include, RSpec::Mocks::Methods)
